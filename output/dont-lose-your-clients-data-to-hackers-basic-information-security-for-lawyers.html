                </h2>

                

                <p>This is an adaptation of an ethics <span class="caps">CLE</span> that I presented at the University of Iowa on October 19, 2018. The idea is to arm lawyers, particularly small-firm and solo practitioners (with limited resources) on a few basic security improvements and ways to think about security in order to protect client data. At the end of this (long) post, you&#8217;ll find references to far more comprehensive&nbsp;resources.</p>
<p>I am not a security professional, though I did run the materials for the <span class="caps">CLE</span> presentation by one or two people who are in order to make sure that there wasn&#8217;t anything totally confused in there. So you shouldn&#8217;t treat this as professional advice, and you really should consult a professional (as usual, all information in here is very much offered without warranty, you assume the risks associated with following advice here). Moreover, this is not meant for people who already have some security practices implemented and are looking to take themselves to the next level&#8212;this is more intended for lawyers who have never thought about information security and are looking for a few&nbsp;basics. </p>
<p>With those caveats in hand, let&#8217;s&nbsp;begin. </p>
<h2>Why should I, a lawyer, worry about information&nbsp;security?</h2>
<p>First of all, <strong>you have a duty to do so</strong>. It&#8217;s widely recognized that the ethical duty of competence includes a duty to be technologically competent. In the words of the <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_1_competence/comment_on_rule_1_1/">comment to <span class="caps">ABA</span> Model Rule 1.1</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>To maintain the requisite knowledge and skill, a lawyer should keep abreast of changes in the law and its practice, including the benefits and risks associated with relevant&nbsp;technology&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and in the words of <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_6_confidentiality_of_information/">Model Rule 1.6</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to prevent the inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure of, or unauthorized access to, information relating to the representation of a&nbsp;client.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, negligence in information security could potentially compromise the attorney-client privilege. See <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_502"><span class="caps">FRE</span> 502(b)(2)</a> (inadvertently disclosed information still protected by privilege <em>if &#8220;the holder of the privilege or protection took reasonable steps to prevent disclosure&#8221;</em>). </p>
<p>In addition, information security may be required by state consumer protection laws, in jurisdictions where lawyers are covered, and, obviously, there&#8217;s also a serious risk of malpractice&nbsp;liability. </p>
<p>Second, <strong>lawyers are increasingly targets of data breach efforts</strong>. Some of those breaches have been successful and huge. Here are some prominent examples (and see <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/law_firm_hacking_history">this <span class="caps">ABA</span> Journal article</a> for&nbsp;more): </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-insidertrading-idUSKBN14G1D5">In 2016</a>, hackers got into the files of (apparently) Cravath and Weil Gotshal to get information about impending mergers, which they used to make millions of dollars in insider&nbsp;trading. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://casetext.com/case/oneill-bragg-staffin-pc-v-bank-of-am-corp">In 2017</a>, hackers got into the e-mail account of a partner in a Pennsylvania law firm and used that access to convince another partner to transfer them half a million dollars from the client trust&nbsp;account. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://canadianlawyermag.com/author/marg-bruineman/phishing-for-victims-17392/">In 2016</a> Dentons Canada was phished into sending away 2.5 million dollars from the client trust&nbsp;account. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/hacker_steals_large_6-figure_sum_from_law_firm_trust_account_using_trojan_b">In 2013</a> the bookkeeper for a Canadian law firm was fooled by a spoofed online banking page and the firm had “a large six-figure”&nbsp;looted.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://fortune.com/2017/06/29/dla-piper-cyber-attack/">In 2017</a>, <span class="caps">DLA</span> Piper suffered a malware attack that led to their entire <span class="caps">IT</span> operation being shut down&#8212;-producing stuff like&nbsp;this: </p>
