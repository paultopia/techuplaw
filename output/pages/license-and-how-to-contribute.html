<p>All contributing authors retain the copyright to material they contribute, and authors as well as dates of creation are listed on each contributed post. Where no author is listed, you may assume <a href="https://gowder.io">Paul Gowder</a> is the author unless specified otherwise. </p>
<p>This site uses the <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> static site generator. It also uses third-party plugins and themes, which appear in the Github repository. License information, where provided, is in those folders or in the Pelican static site generator website and/or Github repository; I (Paul Gowder) disclaim all copyright in modifications made to the third-party theme on this site.

<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>To contribute to this site, write a tutorial in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> format (with a name of the form <code>something.md</code>), as a post, and submit it as a pull request to the <a href="https://github.com/paultopia/techuplaw">site Github repository</a>. All posts should be contributed to the <code>content/tutorials</code> folder in this repository. This site uses tags, not categories, to organize content.</p>
<p>By contributing, you agree that any content you contribute will be available under the licenses described in the first paragraph of this page, though you will retain ownership of the copyright to that content.</p>
<p>In order for your post to work on this site, you'll need to add several lines to the top of your markdown file.  At a minimum, you will need to specify a post title, date, tags, and author. (If you don't include an author, it'll automatically attribute the post to me, which you probably don't want!)  When you select tags, please consult <a href="/tags">the tags page</a> and endeavor where possible to use tags that correspond to existing content.</p>
<p>The following is an example of a minimal post which includes the header block </p>

<p>If you don't know how to submit a pull request, consult <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request">Github's documentation</a>. The basic workflow is to fork the repository, create a branch containing your pull request, and then use Github's web interface to start a pull request.  Then we can talk about it, and, if it's ready, I can merge it into the site... which should immediately publish it if I have things set up right. </p>
